This directory contains MPI-enabled cppunit tests for checking
clusterlib.  Building from the top-level code path will create the
executable 'test' in this directory.

Some tests will be single process and others will use multiple
processes.  In order to run the single process test, do:

./test

In order to run multiple processes, you will use either mpiexec or
mpirun.  One example would be:

mpiexec -n 2 ./test

Each of the processes writes output to its own file (i.e. 0.out,
1.out, etc.).  Additionally, process 0 will display the overall
results to stdout.
